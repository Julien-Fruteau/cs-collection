What is Dependency Injection in C#? [here](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/understanding-the-dependency-injection-using-constructor-property-and-method-in/)

Dependency Injection (DI) is a software pattern. DI is a technique whereby one object supplies the dependencies of another object. With the help of DI, we can write loosely coupled code. A loosely-coupled code is a code where all your classes can work independently without relying on each other. There are four types of DI in C#

Constructor Injection
Setter or property Injection
Method Injection
Service Locator Injection
